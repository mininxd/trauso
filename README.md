## ✨ New Features (v0.1.1)

  - Handles generic "404" or "Unknown Error" gracefully.
- **⚙️ Advanced Queue System**:
  - **Sequential Mode (Default)**: Downloads files 1-by-1 for stability.
  - **Parallel Mode**: Download up to 5 files simultaneously (Async).
  - **Auto Server Switch**: Automatically switches between Server 1 and Server 2 if one fails.
- **🖥️ Seamless Dashboard**: All-in-one interface. No more popup windows.
  - Fetch, Select, and Monitor downloads in a single view.
  - Native "Browse Folder" dialog for download location.
- **🔄 Auto Update**: Automatically checks for updates from GitHub Releases.
- **🛑 Graceful Control**: 
  - Pause/Resume/Cancel individual downloads.
  - "Clear All Queue" to remove pending/error items instantly.
  - Background process management (auto-kill aria2 on exit).

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**"Failed to get info" / 404 Error:**
- Ensure the link is public and not password-protected (password support coming soon).
- Try changing your IP/VPN if Cloudflare is blocking requests.
- The app automatically tries multiple endpoints, so persistent errors usually mean the link is dead or IP banned.

**Download Speed Issues:**
- Trauso uses `aria2` with multi-connection optimization. Speed depends on TeraBox servers and your ISP.
- Try switching between "Server 1" and "Server 2" in Settings.
